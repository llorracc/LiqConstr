  In this section we present the consumer framework underlying all results. We consider a finitely-lived consumer living from period $t$ to $T$ who faces some future risks and liquidity constraints. The consumer is maximizing the time-additive present discounted value of utility from consumption $u(c)$.  With interest and time preference factors $R \in (0,\infty)$ and $\beta \in (0,\infty)$, and labeling consumption $c$, stochastic labor income $y$, end-of-period assets ${a}$, liquidity constraint $\sConst$, and `market resources' (the sum of current income and spendable wealth from the past) ${m}_{t}$, the consumer's problem can be written as
