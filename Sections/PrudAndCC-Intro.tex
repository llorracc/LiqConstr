  This section provides a set of tools necessary to prove our main results. We first define what we mean by consumption concavity and show that consumption concavity, once established, propagates back to prior periods. Next, we define an operation we call a `counterclockwise concavification' which describes how either a liquidity constraint or a risk affects the consumption function. The advantage of defining a counterclockwise concavification in such general terms is that we can show that it heightens prudence of the value function irrespective of the source of concavification. Since the relationship between prudence and precautionary saving has already been established in the literature \citep{kimball:smallandlarge}, the tools in this section allow us to establish how liquidity constraints affect precautionary saving in the subsequent sections.
