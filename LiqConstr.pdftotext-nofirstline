Abstract
We provide the analytical explanation of the interactions between
precautionary saving and liquidity constraints.
The effects of liquidity
constraints and risks are similar because both stem from the same source: a
concavification of the consumption function. Since a more concave consumption
function exhibits heightened prudence, both constraints and risks strengthen
the precautionary saving motive. In addition, we explain the apparently
contradictory results that constraints and risks in some cases intensify, but in
other cases weaken the precautionary saving motive. The central insight is that
the effect of introducing an additional constraint or risk depends on whether it
interacts with pre-existing constraints or risks. If it does not interact with any
pre-existing constraints or risks, it intensifies the precautionary motive. If it does
interact, it may reduce the precautionary motive in earlier periods at some levels
of wealth.

1 Introduction
A large literature has shown that numerical models that take constraints
and uncertainty seriously can yield different conclusions than those that
characterize traditional models. For example, Kaplan, Moll, and Violante
(2018) show that when sufficiently many households have high marginal
propensities to consume (MPC’s), a major transmission channel of monetary policy is the ‘indirect income effect’ – a channel of minimal importance
in traditional macro models. Similarly, Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2017) and
Bayer, Lütticke, Pham-Dao, and Tjaden (2019) show that tightened borrowing conditions and heightened income risk can help explain the consumption
decline during the great recession.
A drawback to numerical solutions is that it is often difficult to know why
results come out the way they do. A leading example is in the complex relationship between precautionary saving behavior and liquidity constraints.1
At least since Zeldes (1984), economists working with numerical solutions
have known that liquidity constraints can strictly increase precautionary
saving under very general circumstances. On the other hand, simulations
have sometimes found circumstances under which liquidity constraints and
precautionary saving are substitutes. In an early example, Samwick (1995)
showed that unconstrained consumers with a precautionary saving motive
in a retirement saving model behave in ways qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the behavior of liquidity constrained consumers facing no
uncertainty.
This paper provides the theoretical tools to make sense of the interactions
between liquidity constraints and precautionary saving. The main theoretical innovation is to conceptualize the effects of either constraints or risks
in terms of consumption concavity. The advantage of understanding the
effects in terms of consumption concavity is that there is a link between
more consumption concavity (concavification) and prudence, and therefore
also precautionary saving (Kimball, 1990). In particular, we show that
prudence of the value function is increased by any concavification of the
consumption function regardless of its cause.
1 For the seminal numerical examination of some of the interactions between precautionary saving
and liquidity constraints, see Deaton (1991).

Our first main result is to show that the introduction of a constraint at
the end of period t causes consumption concavity around the point where
the constraint binds.2 Furthermore, once consumption concavity is created,
it propagates back to periods before t. Carroll and Kimball (1996) showed
similar results for the effects of risks on consumption concavity. Hence, the
two papers establish rigorously that both constraints and risks create a form
of consumption concavity that propagates backward.
Since prudence is heightened when the consumption function is more
concave, it follows immediately that when a liquidity constraint is added
to a standard consumption problem, the resulting value function exhibits
increased prudence around the level of wealth where the constraint becomes
binding.3 Constraints induce precaution because constrained agents have
less flexibility in responding to shocks when the effects of the shocks cannot
be spread out over time. The precautionary motive is heightened by the desire (in the face of risk) to make future constraints less likely to bind.4 This
can explain why such a high percentage of households cite precautionary
motives as the most important reason for saving (Kennickell and Lusardi,
1999) even though the fraction of households who report actually having
been constrained in the past is relatively low (Jappelli, 1990).
After establishing that the introduction of a constraint increases the
precautionary saving motive, we show that the introduction of a further
future constraint may actually reduce the precautionary saving motive by
‘hiding’ the effects of pre-existing constraints or risks. An existing constraint
may be rendered irrelevant at levels of wealth where the new constraint
forces more saving than the existing constraint would induce. Identical logic
implies that uncertainty can ‘hide’ the effects of a constraint because the
consumer may save so much for precautionary reasons that the constraint
2 The connection between constraints and consumption concavity has been explored in more specific
settings. See e.g. Park (2006) for CRRA utility, Seater (1997) for the case where time-discounting equals
the interest rate, Nishiyama and Kato (2012) for quadratic utility, and Holm (2018) for the case with
infinitely-lived households with HARA utility.
3 A relationship between constraints and prudence has also been noted by Lee and Sawada (2007)
and documented empirically in Lee and Sawada (2010).
4 To be clear, the liquidity constraint we analyze here must be satisfied in each period (oneperiod bonds). This implies that the interactions between constraints and income volatility where some
households may prefer to increase (credit card) debt today because they expect tighter credit conditions
in the future are ruled out (Fulford, 2015; Druedahl and Jørgensen, 2018).

becomes irrelevant. Thus, the introduction of a new constraint or risk does
not generally strengthen the precautionary motive.
A concrete example helps clarify the intuition. A typical perfect foresight
model of consumption for a retired consumer with guaranteed income (e.g.,
‘Social Security’) implies that a legal constraint on borrowing can make the
consumer run their wealth down to zero (thereafter setting consumption
equal to income). Now consider modifying the model to incorporate the
possibility of large medical expenses near the end of life (e.g. nursing home
fees; see Ameriks, Caplin, Laufer, and Van Nieuwerburgh, 2011). Under
reasonable assumptions, a consumer facing such a risk may save enough for
precautionary reasons to render the no-borrowing constraint irrelevant.
Although there is no general result for the effects of additional constraints
or risks when the consumer already faces existing constraints or risks, we
can establish how the introduction of all constraints and risks affects the
precautionary saving motive. We show that the precautionary saving motive
is stronger at every level of wealth5 in the presence of all future risks and
constraints than in the case with no risks and constraints. This is because
the consumption function is concave everywhere in the presence of all future
risks and constraints,6 and since consumption concavity heightens prudence
of the value function, the precautionary saving motive is also stronger in
the presence of all risks and constraints than in the case with no risks and
constraints.
Hence, we can summarize this paper as follows. The effects of liquidity
constraints and risks are similar because both stem from the same source:
a concavification of the consumption function. The effects work independently, meaning that neither risks nor constraints are necessary to concavify
the consumption function. And since a more concave consumption function
exhibits heightened prudence, both constraints and risks strengthen the
precautionary saving motive. In addition, we explain the apparently contradictory results that constraints and risks in some cases intensify, but in
other cases weaken the precautionary saving motive. The central insight is
5 More precisely, we show that there is no level of wealth at which the motive is weaker, and at least
some levels at which it is strictly stronger.
6 Again, there is no level of wealth at which the consumption function becomes less concave, and at
least some levels of wealth at which it becomes strictly more concave.

that the effect of introducing an additional constraint or risk depends on
whether it weakens the effects of any pre-existing constraints or risks. If
it does not interact with any pre-existing constraints or risks, it intensifies
the precautionary saving motive. If it does interact, it may weaken the
precautionary saving motive at some levels of wealth.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. To fix notation and ideas,
the next section sets out the general theoretical framework. Section 3 then
defines what we mean by consumption concavity and shows how consumption concavity propagates backward and heightens prudence of the value
function. In Section 4, we show how liquidity constraints cause consumption
concavity and thereby also prudence. And Section 5 presents our results
on the interactions between liquidity constraints and precautionary saving.
The final section concludes.

2 The Setup
In this section we present the consumer framework underlying all results.
We consider a finitely-lived consumer living from period t to T who faces
some future risks and liquidity constraints. The consumer is maximizing
the time-additive present discounted value of utility from consumption u(c).
With interest and time preference factors R ∈ (0, ∞) and β ∈ (0, ∞), and
labeling consumption c, stochastic labor income y, end-of-period assets a,
liquidity constraint ς, and ‘market resources’ (the sum of current income
and spendable wealth from the past) mt , the consumer’s problem can be
written as
" T −t

X
β k u(ct+k )
Vt (mt ) = max Et
c

mt+1
at

k=0

s.t.
= (mt − ct )R + yt+1
= mt − ct

As usual, the recursive nature of the problem makes this equivalent to

4

the Bellman equation
Vt (mt ) = max u(c) + Et [βVt+1 ((mt − c)R + yt+1 )].
c

We define Ωt (at ) = Et [βVt+1 (Rat +yt+1 )] as the end-of-period value function
and rewrite the problem as7
Vt (mt ) = max u(c) + Ωt (mt − c).
c

Throughout, what we call ‘the consumption function’ is the mapping from
market resources mt to consumption. In some of our results we consider
utility functions of the HARA class

quadratic utility (α1 = −1).

3 Consumption Concavity and Prudence
This section provides a set of tools necessary to prove our main results.
We first define what we mean by consumption concavity and show that
consumption concavity, once established, propagates back to prior periods.
Next, we define an operation we call a ‘counterclockwise concavification’
which describes how either a liquidity constraint or a risk affects the consumption function. The advantage of defining a counterclockwise concavification in such general terms is that we can show that it heightens prudence
of the value function irrespective of the source of concavification. Since the

function Ωt (s) as functions simply of wealth and savings, but implicitly these functions reflect the
entire information set as of time t; if, for example, the income process is not i.i.d., then information on
lagged income or income shocks could be important in determining current optimal consumption. In the
remainder of the paper the dependence of functions on the entire information set as of time t will be
unobtrusively indicated, as here, by the presence of the t subscript. For example, we will call the policy
rule in period t which indicates the optimal value of consumption ct (m). In contrast, because we assume
that the utility function is the same from period to period, the utility function has no t subscript.

relationship between prudence and precautionary saving has already been
established in the literature (Kimball, 1990), the tools in this section allow
us to establish how liquidity constraints affect precautionary saving in the
subsequent sections.

3.1 Consumption Concavity
We start by defining what we mean by consumption concavity (CC) and
greater consumption concavity.
Definition 1. (Local Consumption Concavity.)
In relation to a utility function u(c) with u0 > 0, u00 < 0, and non-negative
(u000 ≥ 0) and non-increasing prudence, a function V (m) has property CC
(alternately, strict CC) over the interval between m1 and m2 , where m2 >
m1 , if
V 0 (m) = u0 (c(m))
for some increasing function c(m) that satisfies concavity (alternately, strict
concavity) over the interval from m1 to m2 .
Since (even with constraints) V 0 (m) = u0 (c(m)) holds by the envelope
theorem, V (m) having property CC (alternately, strict CC) is the same as
having a concave (alternately, strictly concave) consumption function c(m).8
Note that the definition is restricted to non-negative and non-increasing
prudence. This encompasses most of the commonly used utility functions
in the economics literature (e.g. CRRA, CARA, quadratic). Also, note that
we allow for ‘non-strict’ concavity – that is, linearity – because we want to
include cases such as quadratic utility in which parts of the consumption
function can be linear. Henceforth, unless otherwise noted, we will drop
the cumbersome usage ‘alternately, strict’ – the reader should assume that
what we mean always applies in the two alternate cases in parallel.
If a function has property local CC at every point, we define it as having
property CC globally.
8 Remember that the envelope theorem depends only on being able to spend current wealth on
current consumption, so it holds whether or not there is a liquidity constraint.

6

Definition 2. (Global Consumption Concavity.)
A function V (m) has property CC in relation to a utility function u(c) with
u0 > 0, u00 < 0, and non-negative (u000 ≥ 0) and non-increasing prudence
if V 0 (m) = u0 (c(m)) for some monotonically increasing concave function
c(m).
We now show that once a value function exhibits the property CC in some
period t + 1, it will also have the property CC in period t and earlier
under fairly general conditions. Lemma 1 formally provides conditions
guaranteeing this recursive propagation.
Lemma 1. (Recursive Propagation of Consumption Concavity.)
Consider an agent with a HARA utility function satisfying u0 > 0, u00 < 0,
u000 ≥ 0 and non-increasing absolute prudence (−u000 /u00 ). Assume that no
liquidity constraint applies at the end of period t and that the agent faces
income risk yt+1 ∈ [y, ȳ]. If Vt+1 (mt+1 ) exhibits property (local) CC for all
mt+1 ∈ [Rat + y, Rat + ȳ], then Vt (mt ) exhibits property (local) CC at the
level of wealth mt such that optimal consumption yields at = mt − ct (mt ).
If also Vt+1 (mt+1 ) exhibits property strict (local) CC for at least one mt+1 ∈
[Rat + y, Rat + ȳ], then Vt (mt ) exhibits property strict (local) CC at the level
of wealth mt where optimal consumption yields at = mt − ct (mt ).
See Appendix A for the proof. The basic insight of Lemma 1 is that as long
as the future consumption function is concave for all realizations of yt+1 ,
then it is also concave today. Additionally, if the the future consumption
function is strictly concave for at least one realization of yt+1 , then the
consumption function is strictly concave also today.
The last circumstance we define is when a value function exhibits ‘greater’
concavity than another. Later, this will allow us to compare two consumption functions and their respective concavity.
Definition 3. (Greater Consumption Concavity.)
Consider two functions V (m) and V̂ (m) that both exhibit property CC with
respect to the same u(c) at a point m for some interval (m1 , m2 ) such that
m1 < m < m2 . Then V̂ (m) exhibits property ‘greater CC’ compared to

for all m ∈ (m1 , m2 ), and property ‘strictly’ greater CC if (2) holds as a
strict inequality.
If c00 and ĉ00 exist everywhere between m1 and m2 , greater concavity of ĉ is
equivalent to ĉ00 being weakly larger in absolute value than c00 everywhere
in the range from m1 to m2 . The strict version of the proposition would
require the inequality to hold strictly over some interval between m1 and
m2 .

3.2 Counterclockwise Concavification
The next concept we introduce is a ‘counterclockwise concavification,’ which
describes an operation that makes the modified consumption function more
concave than in the original situation. The idea is to think of the consumption function in the modified situation as being a twisted version of the
consumption function in the baseline situation, where the kind of twisting
allowed is a progressively larger increase in the MPC as the level of market
resources gets lower. We call this a ‘counterclockwise concavification’ to
describe the sense that at any specific level of market resources, one can
think of the increase in the MPC at lower levels of market resources as
being a counterclockwise rotation of the lower portion of the consumption
function around that level of resources.
Definition 4. (Counterclockwise Concavification.)
Function ĉ(m) is a counterclockwise concavification of c(m) around m# if
the following conditions hold:
1. ĉ(m) = c(m) for m ≥ m#

>1

The limits in the definition are necessary to allow for the possibility of
discrete drops in the MPC at potential ‘kink points’ in the consumption
functions. To understand counterclockwise concavification, it is useful to
derive its implied properties.
Lemma 2. (Properties of a Counterclockwise Concavification.)
If ĉ(m) is a counterclockwise concavification of c(m) around m# and
c00 (m) ≤ 0 for all m, then
1. ĉ(m) < c(m) for m < m# .
2. limµ↑m ĉ0 (µ) > limµ↑m c0 (µ) for m < m# .
3. limµ↑m ĉ00 (µ) ≤ limµ↑m c00 (µ) for m < m# .
See Appendix B for the proof. A counterclockwise concavification thus
reduces consumption, increases the MPC, and makes the consumption function more concave for all levels of market resources below the point of
concavification. A prominent example of a counterclockwise concavification
is income risk. Lemma 3 shows, with a slight abuse of notation, that a set
of well-known results in the literature implies that the introduction of a
current income risk is an example of a counterclockwise concavification of
the consumption function around ∞.
Lemma 3. (Income Risk Causes Counterclockwise Concavification.)
Consider an agent who has a utility function of the HARA class (1) with
u0 > 0, u00 < 0, u000 > 0, and decreasing absolute prudence (−u000 /u00 ). Then
the consumption function in the presence of a current income risk c̃(m) is a
counterclockwise concavification of the consumption function in the presence
of no risk c(m) around ∞.
000

Proof. Kimball (1990) shows that positive absolute prudence − uu00 ensures
that c̃(m) < c(m) for all m. Further, decreasing absolute prudence ensures
that the conditions for Corollary 1 in Carroll and Kimball (1996) are satisfied so that c̃00 (m) < 0 for all m. The two results imply that consumption

9

is lower, the MPC is higher, and the consumption function is more concave
everywhere in the case with risk than in the case with no risk. c̃(m) is
therefore a counterclockwise concavification of c(m) around ∞.

Figure 1 Examples of Counterclockwise Concavifications
Notes: The solid line shows the linear consumption function in the case with no constraints and no
risks. The two dashed lines show the consumption function when we introduce a constraint and a
risk, respectively. The introduction of a constraint is a counterclockwise concavification of the solid
consumption function around m# , while the introduction of a risk is a counterclockwise concavification
around ∞.

Figure 1 illustrates two examples of counterclockwise concavifications: the
introduction of a constraint or a risk. In both cases, we start from the
situation with no risk or constraints (solid line). The constraint causes
a counterclockwise concavification around a kink point m# . Below m# ,
consumption is lower and the MPC is greater. The introduction of a risk also

10

generates a counterclockwise concavification of the original consumption
function, but this time around ∞ as described in Lemma 3.

3.3 A Counterclockwise Concavification Increases Prudence
The section above defined a counterclockwise concavification which describes the effects of either a constraint or a risk on consumption concavity.
This section shows the relationship between consumption concavity and
prudence. Our method is to compare prudence in a baseline case where the
consumption function is c(m) to prudence in a modified situation in which
the consumption function ĉ(m) is a counterclockwise concavification of the
baseline consumption function.
The first result relates to the effects of a counterclockwise
concavification
V 000 (m)
on the absolute prudence of the value function, − V 00 (m) .
Lemma 4. (A Counterclockwise Concavification Increases Prudence.)
Consider an agent who has a utility function with u0 > 0, u00 < 0, u000 ≥ 0,
and non-increasing absolute prudence (−u000 /u00 ). If c(m) is concave and
ĉ(m) is a counterclockwise concavification of c(m), then the value function
associated with ĉ(m) exhibits greater absolute prudence than the value function associated with c(m) for all m.
See Appendix C for the proof. To understand the effects on prudence
of a counterclockwise concavification, note that for a twice differentiable
consumption function and thrice differentiable utility function, absolute
prudence of the value function is defined as
−

u000 (c(m)) 0
c00 (m)
V 000 (m)
=
−
c
(m)
−
V 00 (m)
u00 (c(m))
c0 (m)

(3)

by the envelope condition. The results in Lemma 4 follow directly. Lemma
4 additionally handles cases where the consumption function is not necessarily twice differentiable. There are three channels through which a
counterclockwise concavification heightens prudence. First, the increase
in consumption concavity from the counterclockwise concavification itself
heightens prudence. Second, if absolute prudence of the utility function is
non-increasing, then the reduction in consumption (for some states) from

11

the counterclockwise concavification heightens prudence (at those states).
And third, the higher marginal propensity to consume (MPC) from the
counterclockwise concavification means that any given variation in market
resources results in larger variation in consumption, increasing prudence.
The channels operate separately, implying that a counterclockwise concavification heightens prudence even if absolute prudence is zero as in the
quadratic case.9 Lemma 4 only provides conditions for when the value
function exhibits greater prudence, but not strictly greater prudence. In
particular, the value function associated with ĉ(m) will in some cases (e.g.,
quadratic utility) have equal prudence for most m and strictly greater
prudence only for some m. In Lemma 5, we provide conditions for when
the value function has strictly greater prudence.
Lemma 5. (A Counterclockwise Concavification Strictly Increases Prudence.)
Consider an agent who has a utility function with u0 > 0, u00 < 0, u000 ≥ 0,
and non-increasing absolute prudence (−u000 /u00 ). If c(m) is concave and
ĉ(m) is a counterclockwise concavification of c(m) around m# , then the
value function associated with ĉ(m) exhibits strictly greater prudence than
the value function associated with c(m) if the utility function satisfies u000 > 0
0 (m)
strictly
and m < m# or the utility function is quadratic (u000 = 0) and cĉ0 (m)
declines at m.
See Appendix D for the proof. For prudent consumers (u000 > 0), the value
function exhibits strictly greater prudence for all m where the counterclockwise concavification affects consumption. This is because a reduction
in consumption and higher marginal propensity to consume heighten prudence if the utility function has a positive third derivative and prudence
is non-increasing. If the utility function instead is quadratic, the third
derivative is zero and absolute prudence of the value function does not
depend on the level of consumption or the marginal propensity to consume.
In this case, the counterclockwise concavification only
affects prudence at
ĉ0 (m)
the kink points in the consumption function (where c0 (m) strictly declines at
m). We have now defined consumption concavity and the operation called
9 cf.

a counterclockwise concavification. In particular, we have shown that a
counterclockwise concavification heightens prudence, which is related the
precautionary saving. The next section shows how the introduction of a
liquidity constraint is a counterclockwise concavification before we use the
tools derived in this section to provide the link between liquidity constraints
and precautionary saving in Section 5.

4 Liquidity Constraints and Consumption
Concavity
This section shows under which conditions liquidity constraints cause consumption concavity. The main conceptual difficulty with liquidity constraints is that the effect of introducing a new constraint depends on already
existing constraints. To get around this issue, we introduce the concept of
an ordered set of relevant constraints. This allows us to add constraints in
such a way that the next constraint does not affect behavior related to preexisting constraints. Our main result (Theorem 1) is that the introduction
of the next constraint from the ordered set of relevant constraints causes
a counterclockwise concavification of the consumption function. It then
follows from the results in Section 3 that the introduction of the next
constraint also heightens prudence of the value function.

4.1 Liquidity Constraints and Kink Points
Recall that we are working with a consumer whose horizon goes from 0 to
T . We define a liquidity constraint dated t as a constraint that requires
savings at the end of period t ∈ (0, T ] to be non-negative (the assumption
of non-negativity is without loss of generality as shown in Theorem 1). We
first define what we mean by a kink point which is induced by a constraint.
To have a distinct terminology for the effects of current-period and futureperiod constraints, we will use the word ‘binds’ to refer to the potential
effects of a constraint in the period in which it applies and will use the
term ‘impinges’ to describe the effect of a future constraint on current
consumption.

13

Definition 5. (Kink Point.)
We define a kink point, ωt,n as the level of market resources at which constraint n stops binding or impinging on time t consumption.
A kink point corresponds to a transition from a level of market resources
where a current constraint binds or a future constraint impinges, to a level
of market resources where that constraint no longer binds or impinges. The
timing of a constraint relative to other existing constraints matters for the
effects of the constraint. We therefore define an ordered set to keep track
of the existing constraints.
Definition 6. (An Ordered Set of Relevant Constraints.)
We define T as an ordered set of dates at which a relevant constraint exists.
We define T [1] as the last period in which a constraint exists, T [2] as the
date of the last period before T [1] in which a constraint exists, and so on.
T is the set of relevant constraints, ordered from the last to the first
constraint. We order them from last to first because a constraint in period
t only affects behavior prior to period t (in addition to t itself). The
set of constraints from period t to T summarizes all relevant information
in period t. Further, and as discussed below, the effect of imposing the
next constraint in T on consumption is unambiguous only if one imposes
constraints chronologically from last to first. For any t ∈ [0, T ), we define
ct,n as the optimal consumption function in period t assuming that the
first n constraints in T have been imposed. For example, ct,0 (m) is the
consumption function in period t when no constraints have been imposed,
ct,1 (m) is the consumption function in period t after the chronologically last
constraint has been imposed, and so on. Ωt,n , Vt,n , and other functions are
defined correspondingly.

4.2 A Fixed Set of Constraints
We first consider an initial situation in which a consumer is solving a perfect
foresight optimization problem with a finite horizon that begins in period t
and ends in period T . The consumer begins with market resources mt and
earns constant income y in each period. Lemma 6 shows how this consumer’s

14

behavior in period t changes from an initial situation with n ≥ 0 constraints
to a situation in which n + 1 liquidity constraints has been imposed.
Lemma 6. (Liquidity Constraints Cause Counterclockwise Concavification.)
Consider an agent who has a utility function with u0 > 0 and u00 < 0, faces
constant income y, and is impatient (βR < 1). Assume that the agent faces
a set T of N relevant constraints. Then ct,n+1 (m) is a counterclockwise
concavification of ct,n (m) around ωt,n+1 for n ≤ N − 1.
See Appendix E for the proof. When we have an ordered set of constraints,
T , the introduction of the next constraint generates a counterclockwise
concavification of the consumption function.

4.3 Additional Constraints
Lemma 6 analyzes the case where there is a preordained set of constraints
T which were applied sequentially in reverse chronological order. We now
examine how behavior will be modified if we add a new date τ̂ to the set
of dates at which the consumer is constrained. Call the new set of dates
T̂ with N + 1 constraints (one more constraint than before), and call the
consumption rules corresponding to the new set of dates ĉt,1 through ĉt,N +1 .
Now call m the number of constraints in T at dates strictly greater than τ̂ .
Then note that that ĉτ̂,m = cτ̂,m , because at dates after the date at which the
new constraint (number m+1) is imposed, consumption is the same as in the
absence of the new constraint. Now recall that imposition of the constraint
at τ̂ causes a counterclockwise concavification of the consumption function
around a new kink point, ωτ̂,m+1 . That is, ĉτ̂,m+1 is a counterclockwise
concavification of ĉτ̂,m = cτ̂,m . The most interesting observation, however,
is that behavior under constraints T̂ in periods strictly before τ̂ cannot
be described as a counterclockwise concavification of behavior under T .
The reason is that the values of wealth at which the earlier constraints
caused kink points in the consumption functions before period τ̂ will not
generally correspond to kink points once the extra constraint has been
added.
Figure 2 presents an example. The original T contains only
a single constraint, at the end of period t + 1, inducing a kink point at

15

ωt,1 in the consumption rule ct,1 . The expanded set of constraints T̂ adds
one constraint at period t + 2. T̂ induces two kink points in the updated
consumption rule ĉt,2 , at ω̂t,1 and ω̂t,2 . It is true that imposition of the
new constraint causes consumption to be lower than before at every level
of wealth below ω̂t,1 . However, this does not imply higher prudence of the
value function at every m < ω̂t,1 . In particular, the original consumption
function is strictly concave at ωt,1 , while the new consumption function is
linear at ωt,1 , so prudence is greater before than after imposition of the
new constraint at ωt,1 . The intuition is straightforward. At levels of initial
wealth below ω̂t,1 , the consumer had been planning to end period t + 2 with
negative wealth. With the new constraint, the old plan of ending up with
negative wealth is no longer feasible and the consumer will save more for
any given level of current wealth below ω̂t,1 , including ωt,1 . But the reason
ωt,1 was a kink point in the initial situation was that it was the level of
wealth where consumption would have been equal to market resources in
period t + 1. Now, because of the extra savings induced by the constraint
in t + 2, the period t + 1 constraint will no longer bind for a consumer who
begins period t with wealth ωt,1 . In other words, at wealth ωt,1 the extra
savings induced by the new constraint prevents the original constraint from
being relevant at ωt,1 . Notice, however, that all constraints that existed in
T will remain relevant at some m under T̂ even after the new constraint is
imposed - they just induce kink points at different levels of market resources
than before (in Figure 2, the first constraint causes a kink at ω̂t,2 rather than
ωt,1 ).

4.4 A More General Analysis
The preceding analyses required income to be constant, the liquidity constraints to be of the no-borrowing type, and consumers to be impatient
(βR < 1). We now relax these requirements. Under these more general
circumstances, a constraint imposed in a given period can render constraints
in either earlier or later periods irrelevant. For example, consider a consumer
with CRRA utility and βR = 1 who earns income of 1 in each period, but
who is required to arrive at the end of period T − 2 with savings of 5.

16

Then a constraint that requires savings to be greater than zero at the end
of period T − 3 will have no effect because the consumer is required by the
constraint in period T − 2 to end period T − 3 with savings greater than
4. Formally, consider now imposing the first constraint, which applies in
period τ < T . The simplest case, analyzed before, was a constraint that
requires the minimum level of end-of-period wealth to be aτ ≥ 0. Here we
generalize this to aτ ≥ ςτ,1 where in principle we can allow borrowing by
choosing ςτ,1 to be a negative number. Now for constraint 1 calculate the
kink points for prior periods from
0
u0 (c#
τ,1 ) = Rβu (cτ +1,0 (Rςτ,1 + yτ +1 ))
0 −1 0 #
ωτ,1 = (Vτ,1
) (u (cτ,1 )).

(4)
(5)

In addition, for constraint 2 recursively calculate
ς τ −1,1 = (ςτ,1 − yτ,2 + c)/R

(6)

where ς τ −1,1 is the level of wealth that constraint 1 requires the agent to
end period τ − 1 with and c is the lower bound for the value of consumption
permitted by the model (independent of constraints).10 Now assume that
the first n constraints in T have been imposed, and consider imposing
constraint number n + 1, which we assume applies at the end of period τ .
The first thing to check is whether constraint number n + 1 is relevant given
the already-imposed set of constraints. This is simple: A constraint that
requires aτ ≥ ςτ,n+1 will be irrelevant if maxi∈[1,n] [ς τ,i ] ≥ ςτ,n+1 , i.e. if one of
the existing constraints already implies that savings must be greater or equal
to value required by the new constraint. If the constraint is irrelevant then
the analysis proceeds simply by dropping this constraint and renumbering
the constraints in T so that the former constraint n + 2 becomes constraint
n + 1, n + 3 becomes n + 2, and so on. Now consider the other possible
problem: That constraint number n + 1 imposed in period τ will render
irrelevant some of the constraints that have already been imposed. This
10 For example, CRRA utility is well defined only on the positive real numbers, so for a CRRA utility
consumer c = 0. In other cases, for example with exponential or quadratic cases, there is nothing to
prevent consumption of −∞, so for those models c = −∞, unless there is a desire to restrict the model
to positive values of consumption, in which case the c ≥ 0 constraint will be implemented through the
use of (6).

17

too is simple to check: It will be true if the proposed ςτ,n+1 ≥ ςτ,i for
any i ≤ n and for all m.11 The fix is again simple: Counting down from
i = n, find the smallest value of i for which ςτ,n+1 ≥ ςτ,i . Then we know
that constraint n + 1 has rendered constraints i through n irrelevant. The
solution is to drop these constraints from T and start the analysis over
again with the modified T . If this set of procedures is followed until the
chronologically earliest relevant constraint has been imposed, the result will
be a T that contains a set of constraints that can be analyzed as in the
simpler case. In particular, proceeding from the final T [1] through T [N ], the
imposition of each successive constraint in T now causes a counterclockwise
concavification of the consumption function around successively lower values
of wealth as progressively earlier constraints are applied and the result is
again a piecewise linear and strictly concave consumption function with the
number of kink points equal to the number of constraints that are relevant at
any feasible level of wealth in period t. The preceding discussion establishes
the following result:
Theorem 1. (Liquidity Constraints Cause Counterclockwise Concavification.)
Consider an agent in period t who has a utility function with u0 > 0, u00 < 0,
u000 ≥ 0, and non-increasing absolute prudence (−u000 /u00 ). Assume that
the agent faces a set T of N relevant constraints. Then ct,n+1 (m) is a
counterclockwise concavification of ct,n (m) around ωt,n+1 .
Theorem 1 is a generalization of Lemma 6. Even if we relax the assumptions
that income is constant and the agent is impatient, the imposition of an
extra (more general) constraint increases absolute prudence of the value
function as long as we are careful when we select the set T of relevant
constraints. For an agent that only faces liquidity constraints, but no
risk, the shape of the consumption function is piecewise linear. Since the
consumption function is piecewise linear, the new consumption function,
ct,n+1 (m) is not necessarily strictly more concave than ct,n (m) for all m.
This is where the concept of counterclockwise concavification is useful. Even
11 If a constraint is irrelevant for the lowest m that t could enter period τ with, then it is irrelevant
for all m.

18

though ct,n+1 (m) is not strictly more concave than ct,n (m) everywhere, it
is a counterclockwise concavification and we can apply Lemma 4 and 5 to
show that the introduction of the next liquidity constraint increases absolute
prudence of the value function.
Corollary 1. (Liquidity Constraints Increase Prudence.)
Consider an agent in period t who has a utility function with u0 > 0, u00 < 0,
u000 ≥ 0, and non-increasing absolute prudence (−u000 /u00 ). Assume that the
agent faces a set T of N relevant constraints. When n ≤ N − 1 constraints
have been imposed, the imposition of constraint n + 1 strictly increases
absolute prudence of the agent’s value function if the utility function satisfies

u000 > 0 and mt < ωt,n+1 or if u000 = 0 and t,n+1

Proof. By Theorem 1, the imposition of constraint n + 1 constitutes a
counterclockwise concavification of ct,n (m). By Lemma 4 and 5, such a concavification (strictly) increases absolute prudence of the value function.

5 Liquidity Constraints and Precautionary
Saving
The preceding sections established the relationship between liquidity constraints, consumption concavity, and prudence. This section derives the
last step to understand the relationship between liquidity constraints and
precautionary saving. First, we explain how prudence of the value function
affects precautionary saving. Theorem 2 then shows how the introduction
of an additional constraint induces agents to increase precautionary saving
when they face a current risk. The results in Theorem 2 cannot be generalized to an added risk or liquidity constraint in a later time period because it
may hide or alter the effects of current constraints or risks and thereby affect
local precautionary saving. The main conceptual issue with having both
risks and constraints is that the trick with the relevant constraints applied
in Section 4 no longer applies in a setting with risk because constraints may
be relevant for some sample paths. However, we still derive our most general

19

result in Theorem 3: the introduction of an additional risk results in more
precautionary saving in the presence of all future risks and constraints than
in the case with no future risks and constraints.

5.1 Notation
We begin by defining two marginal value functions V 0 (m) and V̂ 0 (m) which
are convex, downward sloping, and continuous in wealth, m. We consider
a risk ζ with support [ζ, ζ̄], and follow Kimball (1990) by defining the
Compensating Precautionary Premia (CPP) as the values κ and κ̂ such
that
V 0 (m) = E[V 0 (m + ζ + κ)]
V̂ 0 (m) = E[V̂ 0 (m + ζ + κ̂)].

(7)
(8)

The CPP can be interpreted as the additional resources an agent requires
to be indifferent between accepting the risk and not accepting the risk. The
relevant part of Pratt (1964)’s Theorem 1 as reinterpreted using Kimball
(1990)’s Lemma (p. 57) can be restated as
Lemma 7. Let A(m) and Â(m) be absolute prudence of the value functions
V and V̂ respectively at m,12 and let κ and κ̂ be the respective compensating
precautionary premia associated with imposition of a given risk ζ as per (7)
and (8). Then the following conditions are equivalent:
1. Â(m + ζ + κ) ≥ A(m + ζ + κ) for all ζ ∈ [ζ, ζ̄] and Â(m + ζ + κ) >
A(m + ζ + κ) for at least one [no] point ζ ∈ [ζ, ζ̄] and a given m.
2. κ̂ > [=]κ for all ζ ∈ [ζ, ζ̄] and the same given m.
Lemma 7 establishes that greater prudence is equivalent to inducing a
greater precautionary premium. For our purpose, it means that our results
above on absolute prudence also imply that the precautionary premium is
higher. Hence, a more prudent consumer requires a higher compensation to
12 A small technicality: Absolute prudence of value functions is infinite at kink points in the
consumption function, so if both c(m) and ĉ(m) had a kink point at exactly the same m, the comparison
of prudence would not yield a well-defined answer. Under these circumstances we will say that
Â(m) ≥ A(m) if the decline in the MPC is greater for ĉ(m) at m than for c(m).

20

be indifferent about facing the risk or not.13 We now take up the question of
how the introduction of a risk ζt+1 that will be realized at the beginning of
period t+1 affects consumption in period t in the presence and in the absence
of a subsequent constraint. To simplify the discussion, consider a consumer
for whom β = R = 1, with mean income y in period t + 1. Assume that
the realization of the risk ζt+1 will be some value ζ with support [ζ,ζ̄], and
signify a decision rule that takes account of the presence of the immediate
risk by a ∼. Further, define ω̄t,n+1 as the lowest level of market resources
required for the liquidity constraint to never bind.
Definition 7. (Wealth Limit.)
ω̄ t,n+1 is the level of wealth such that an agent who faces risk ζt+1 and n + 1
constraints saves enough to guarantee that constraint n + 1 will never bind
in period t + 1. Its value is given by:

−1
0
(9)
ω̄ t,n+1 = Ṽt,n+1
(Ω̃0t,n+1 (ωt+1,n+1 − (y + ζ)))
How to read this limit: ωt+1,n+1 is the level of wealth at which constraint
n + 1 makes the transition from binding to not binding in period t + 1.
ωt+1,n+1 − (y + ζ) is the level of wealth in period t + 1 that ensures that
constraint n + 1 does not bind in period t + 1 even with the worst possible
draw, ζ.
We must be careful to check that ωt+1,n+1 − (y + ζ) is inside the set of
feasible values of at (e.g. positive for consumers with CRRA utility). If
this is not true for some level of market resources, then the constraint is
irrelevant because the restriction imposed by the risk is more stringent than
the restriction imposed by the constraint.

5.2 Precautionary Saving with Liquidity Constraints
We are now in a position to analyze the relationship between precautionary
saving and liquidity constraints. Our first result regards the effect of an
13 Note that precautionary premia are not equivalent to precautionary saving effects because
precautionary premia apply at a given level of consumption, while precautionary saving applies at a
given level of wealth.

21

additional constraint on the precautionary saving of a household facing risk
at the beginning of period t + 1.
Theorem 2. (Liquidity Constraints Increase Precautionary Saving.)
Consider an agent who has a utility function with u0 > 0, u00 < 0, u000 > 0,
and non-increasing absolute prudence (−u000 /u00 ), and who faces the risk,
ζt+1 . Assume that the agent faces a set T of N relevant constraints and
n ≤ N − 1. Then
ct,n+1 (m) − c̃t,n+1 (m) ≥ ct,n (m) − c̃t,n (m),

(10)

and the inequality is strict if wealth is less than the level that ensures that
constraint n + 1 never binds (mt < ω̄t,n+1 ).
See Appendix F for the proof. Theorem 2 shows that the introduction of the
next constraint induces the agent to save more for precautionary reasons in
response to an immediate risk as long as there is a positive probability that
the next constraint will bind. Theorem 2 can be generalized to period s < t
if there is no risk or constraint between period s and t by defining ω̄s,n+1 as
the wealth level at which the agent will arrive in the beginning of period t
with wealth ω̄t,n+1 .
To illustrate the result in Theorem 2, Figure 3 shows an example of
optimal consumption rules in period t under different combinations of an
immediate risk (realized at the beginning of period t + 1) and a future
constraint (applying at the end of period t + 1). The thinner loci reflect
behavior of consumers who face the future constraint, and the dashed loci
reflect behavior of consumers who face the immediate risk. For levels of
wealth above ωt,1 where the future constraint stops impinging on current
behavior for perfect foresight consumers, behavior of the constrained and
unconstrained perfect foresight consumers is the same. Similarly, c̃t,1 (mt ) =
c̃t,0 (mt ) for levels of wealth above ω̄ t,1 beyond which the probability of the
future constraint binding is zero. For both constrained and unconstrained
consumers, the introduction of the risk reduces the level of consumption
(the dashed loci are below their solid counterparts). The significance of
Theorem 2 in this context is that for levels of wealth below ω̄ t,1 , the vertical
distance between the solid and the dashed loci is greater for the constrained

22

(thin line) than for the unconstrained (thick line) consumers because of the
interaction between the liquidity constraint and the precautionary motive.

5.3 Additional Constraints or Risks?
The result in Theorem 2 is limited to the effects of an additional constraint
when a household faces income risk that is realized at the beginning of
period t+1. One might think that this could be generalized to a proposition
that precautionary saving increases if we for example impose an immediate
constraint or an earlier risk, or generally impose multiple constraints or
risks. However, it turns out that the answer is “not necessarily” to all
these possible scenarios. The insight here is that it is no longer possible
to use the trick of the relevant constraints or risks in the previous section.
In a perfect-foresight environment as in Section 4 and Theorem 2, there
was a stark demarcation between relevant and irrelevant constraints. In an
environment with risk, this no longer holds because in the presence of risk,
constraints and risks may be relevant for some sample paths. The additional
constraints and risks may therefore reduce precautionary saving for some
levels of m and we cannot derive more general results on additional risks
or constraints. We provide two examples to illustrate this: an immediate
constraint and an earlier risk.
To describe these examples, we need a last bit of notation. Define cm
t,n as
the consumption function in period t assuming that the first n constraints
and the first m risks have been imposed, counting risks, like constraints,
backwards from period T . All other functions are defined correspondingly.
We will continue to use the notation c̃t,n to designate the effects of imposition
of a single immediate risk realized at the beginning of period t + 1.
5.3.1 An Immediate Constraint
Consider a situation in which no constraint applies between t and T illustrated in Figure 4. Since c0t,0 designates the consumption rule that will
be optimal prior to imposing the period-t constraint, the consumption rule
imposing the constraint will be c0t,1 (m) = min[c0t,0 (m), m]. Now define the
level of market resources below which the period t constraint binds for a

23

0
0
consumer not facing the risk as ωt,1
. For values of m ≥ ωt,1
, analysis of the
effects of the risk is identical to analysis in the previous subsection. For
1
where the constraint binds both in the
levels of market resources m < ωt,1
presence and the absence of the immediate risk, we have c1t,1 (m) = c0t,n (m) =
1
m. Hence, for consumers with wealth below ωt,1
, the introduction of the
risk in period t + 1 has no effect on consumption in t, because for these
levels of savings at the end of t, the consumers where constrained before the
risk was imposed and remain constrained afterwards. Hence, the immediate
constraint hides the risk from view and the precautionary saving in response
to the risk is higher in the absence of the constraint than in the presence of
1
the constraint when m ≤ ωt,1
.

5.3.2 An Earlier Risk
Consider now the question of how the addition of a risk ζt that will be
realized at the beginning of period t affects the consumption function at the
beginning of period t − 1, in the absence of any constraint at the beginning
of period t. The question is whether we can say that the introduction of the
risk ζt has a greater precautionary effect on consumption in the presence of
the subsequent risk ζt+1 than in its absence?
The answer again is “not necessarily.” To see why, we present an example
in Appendix G of a CRRA utility problem in which in a certain limit the
introduction of a risk produced an effect on the consumption function that
is indistinguishable from the effect of a liquidity constraint. If the risk ζt
is of this liquidity-constraint-indistinguishable form, then the logic of the
previous subsection applies: For some levels of wealth, the introduction of
the risk at t can weaken the precautionary effect of any risks at t + 1 or
later.

5.4 All Risks and Constraints
It might seem that the previous subsection implies that little useful can
be said about the precautionary effects of introducing a new risk in the
presence of preexisting constraints and risks. It turns out, however, that
there is one useful result about the introduction of all risks and constraints.

24

Theorem 3. (Liquidity Constraints and Risks Increase Precautionary Saving.)
Consider an agent who has a utility function with u0 > 0, u00 < 0, u000 > 0,
and non-increasing absolute prudence (−u000 /u00 ). Then the introduction of
a risk ζt+1 has a greater precautionary effect on period t consumption in the
presence of all future risks and constraints than in the absence of any future
risks and constraints, i.e.
m
0
1
cm−1
t,n (m) − ct,n (m) > ct,0 (m) − ct,0 (m)

(11)

at levels of period-t market resources m such that in the absence of the new
risk the consumer is not constrained in the current period (cm−1
t,n (m) > m)
and in the presence of the risk there is a positive probability that some future
constraint will bind.
Appendix H presents the proof. A fair summary of this theorem is that
in most circumstances the presence of future constraints and risks does
increase the amount of precautionary saving induced by the introduction of
a given new risk. The primary circumstance under which this should not
be expected is for levels of wealth at which the consumer was constrained
even in the absence of the new risk. There is no guarantee that the new
risk will produce a sufficiently intense precautionary saving motive to move
the initially-constrained consumer off his constraint. If it does, the effect
will be precautionary, but it is possible that no effect will occur.
Our last result is part of the proof of Theorem 3, but we state it explicitly
as a corollary.
Corollary 2. (Liquidity Constraints and Risk Cause Counterclockwise
Concavification.)
Consider an agent who has a utility function with u0 > 0, u00 < 0, u000 > 0,
and non-increasing absolute prudence (−u000 /u00 ). Then the consumption
function in the presence of m future risks and n constraints cm
t,n is a
counterclockwise concavification of the consumption function with no risk
and no constraints c0t,0 .
Corollary 2 states that the consumption function in the presence of all
future risks and constraints is a counterclockwise concavification of the

25

consumption function with no risks or constraints. In other words, the
consumption function is concave in the presence of all future risks and
constraints.

6 Conclusion
The central message of this paper is that the effects of liquidity constraints
and of future risks on precautionary saving are similar because the introduction of either a liquidity constraints or a risk makes the consumption
function more concave than the perfect foresight consumption function.
Such an increase in concavity heightens prudence, inducing consumers at
any affected level of wealth to save more for precautionary reasons.
In addition, we provide an explanation of apparently contradictory results: That constraints in some cases intensify and in other cases weaken
those motives. The insight here is that the effect of introducing a constraint or risk depends on whether it weakens the effect of any pre-existing
constraints or risks. If the new constraint or risk does not interact in any
way with existing constraints or risks, it intensifies the precautionary saving
motive. If it ‘hides’ or moves the effect of any existing constraints or risks,
it may weaken the precautionary saving motive at some levels of market
resources.

Appendix
A Proof of Lemma 1
Proof. First, to facilitate readability of the proof, we assume that R =
β = 1 with no loss of generality. Our goal is to prove that V (mt ) ∈ CC if
Vt+1 (at + yt+1 ) ∈ CC for all realizations of yt+1 . The proof proceeds in two
steps. First, we show that property CC is preserved through the expectation
operator (vertical aggregation), i.e. that Ω(at ) = Et [Vt+1 (at + yt+1 )] ∈ CC
if Vt+1 (at + yt+1 ) ∈ CC for all realizations of yt+1 . Second, we show that
property CC is preserved through the value function operator (horizontal
aggregation), i.e. that V (mt ) = maxs u(ct (mt − s)) + Ω(s) ∈ CC if Ω(s) ∈
CC. Throughout the proof, the first order condition holds with equality
since no liquidity constraint applies at the end of period t.
Step 1: Vertical aggregation
We show that consumption concavity is preserved under vertical aggregation
for three cases of the HARA utility function with u000 ≥ 0 (α1 ≥ −1) and
non-increasing absolute prudence (α1 ∈
/ (−1, 0)). The three cases are


α1 c + b
α1 = −1 (Quadratic)
Case I (α1 > 0, CRRA.) We will show that concavity is preserved under
vertical aggregation for c−1/α1 to avoid clutter, but the results hold for all
affine transformations, α1 c + b, with α1 > 0. Concavity of ct+1 (at + yt+1 )
implies that
ct+1 (at + yt+1 ) ≥ pct+1 (a1 + yt+1 ) + (1 − p)ct+1 (a2 + yt+1 )

(13)

for all yt+1 ∈ [y, ȳ] if at = pa1 + (1 − p)a2 with p ∈ [0, 1]. Since this holds
for all yt+1 , we know that

which implies that
(Ω0 (at ))−α1 ≥ p(Ω0 (a1 ))−α1 + (1 − p)(Ω0 (a2 ))−α1

Thus, defining χt (at ) = {Ωt (at )}−α1 , we get
χt (at ) ≥ pχt (a1 ) + (1 − p)χt (a2 )
for all at , where the inequality is strict if ct+1 is strictly concave for at least
one realization of yt+1 . Case II (a = 0, CARA). For the exponential case,
property CC holds at at if
exp(−χt (at )/b) = Et [exp(−ct+1 (at + yt+1 )/b)]
for some χt (at ) which is strictly concave at at . We set b = 1 to reduce
clutter, but results hold for b 6= 1. Consider first a case where ct+1 is linear
over the range of possible values of at + yt+1 , then
χt (at ) = − log Et [e−ct+1 (at +yt+1 ) ]

= − log Et [e−(ct+1 (at +ȳ)+(yt+1 −ȳ)ct+1 ) ]
0

= ct+1 (at + ȳ) − log Et [e−(yt+1 −ȳ)ct+1 ]

28

(14)

which is linear in at since the second term is a constant. Now consider
a value of at for which ct+1 (at + yt+1 ) is strictly concave for at least one
realization of yt+1 . Global weak concavity of ct+1 tells us that for every yt+1
−ct+1 (at + yt+1 ) ≤ −((1 − p)ct+1 (a1 + yt+1 ) + pct+1 (a2 + yt+1 ))
Et [e−ct+1 (at +yt+1 ) ] ≤ Et [e−((1−p)ct+1 (a1 +yt+1 )+pct+1 (a2 +yt+1 )) ].
(15)
Meanwhile, the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality states that for positive u and v, if ū = Et [u] and v̄ = Et [v], then


Et (u/ū)p (v/v̄)1−p ≤ Et [p(u/ū) + (1 − p)(v/v̄)] = 1,
implying that
Et [up v 1−p ] ≤ ūp v̄ 1−p ,
where the expression holds with equality only if v is proportional to u.
Substituting in u = e−ct+1 (a1 +yt+1 ) and v = e−ct+1 (a2 +yt+1 ) , this means that

which holds with equality only when e−ct+1 (a1 +yt+1 ) /e−ct+1 (a2 +yt+1 ) is a constant. This will only happen if ct+1 (a1 + yt+1 ) − ct+1 (a2 + yt+1 ) is constant, which (given that the MPC is strictly positive everywhere) requires
ct+1 (at + yt+1 ) to be linear for yt+1 ∈ (y, ȳ). Hence,
χt (at ) ≥ pχt (a1 ) + (1 − p)χt (a2 ).
where the inequality is strict for an at from which ct+1 is strictly concave
for some realization of yt+1 .
Case III (a = −1, Quadratic). In the quadratic case, linearity of marginal
utility implies that
u0 (χt (at )) = Et [u0 (ct+1 (at + yt+1 ))]
χt (at ) = Et [ct+1 (at + yt+1 )]

29

so χt is simply the weighted sum of a set of concave functions where the
weights correspond to the probabilities of the various possible outcomes for
yt+1 . The sum of concave functions is itself concave. And if additionally the
consumption function is strictly concave at any point, the weighted sum is
also strictly concave.
Step 2: Horizontal aggregation:
We now proceed with horizontal aggregation, namely how concavity is
preserved through the value function operation. Assume that Ωt (at ) ∈ CC
at point at , then the first order condition implies that
Ω0t (at ) = u0 (χt (at ))
for some monotonically increasing χt (at ) that satisfies
χt (pa1 + (1 − p)a2 ) ≥ pχt (a1 ) + (1 − p)χt (a2 )

(17)

for any 0 < p < 1, and a1 < at < a2 .
In addition, we know that the first order condition holds with equality
such that Ω0t (at ) = u0 (ct (mt )) = u0 (χt (at )) which implies that at = χ−1
t (ct ).
Using this equation, we get
χt (pa1 + (1 − p)a2 ) ≥ pχt (a1 ) + (1 − p)χt (a2 )
pa1 + (1 − p)a2 ≥ χ−1
t (pχt (a1 ) + (1 − p)χt (a2 ))
−1
−1
pχt (c1 ) + (1 − p)χt (c2 ) ≥ χ−1
t (pc1 + (1 − p)c2 )
which implies that χ−1
is a convex function.
t
Use the budget constraint to define
m t = at + c t
ω(ct ) = χ−1 (ct ) + ct
Now, since χ−1
is a convex function, and ω(ct ) is the sum of a convex and
t
a linear function, it is also a convex function satisfying
pω(c1 ) + (1 − p)ω(c2 ) ≥ ω(pc1 + (1 − p)c2 )
ω (pω(c1 ) + (1 − p)ω(c2 )) ≥ pc1 + (1 − p)c2
c(pm1 + (1 − p)m2 ) ≥ pc(m1 ) + (1 − p)c(m2 )
−1

so c is concave.

(18)

Note that the proof of horizontal aggregation works for any utility function with u0 > 0 and u00 < 0 when R = β = 1. However, for the more general
case where R or β are not equal to one, we need the HARA property that
multiplying u0 by a constant corresponds to a linear transformation of c.
Strict Consumption Concavity. When Vt+1 (mt+1 ) exhibits the property
strict CC for at least one mt+1 ∈ [Rat + y, Rat + ȳ], we know that χt (at ) also
exhibits the property strict CC from the proof of vertical aggregation. Then,
equation (17) holds with strict inequality, and this strict inequality goes
through the proof of horizontal aggregation, implying that equation (18)
holds with strict inequality. Hence, ct (mt ) is strictly concave if ct+1 (at +yt+1 )
is concave for all realizations of yt+1 and strictly concave for at least one
realization of yt+1 .

B Proof of Lemma 2
Proof. First, condition 2 and 4 in Definition 4 imply that ĉ0 (m) > c0 (m) for
m = m# −  for a small  > 0. Condition 3 then ensures that limµ↑m ĉ0 (µ) >
limµ↑m c0 (µ) holds for all m ≤ m# −  (equivalently m < m# ). Second,
condition 1 and the fact that limµ↑m ĉ0 (µ) > limµ↑m c0 (µ) for m < m# implies
that limµ↑m ĉ(µ) < limµ↑m c(µ) for m < m# . Third, condition 3 in Definition

C Proof of Lemma 4
Proof. By the envelope theorem, we know that
V 0 (m) = u0 (c(m))
Differentiating with respect to m yields
V 00 (m) = u00 (c(m))c0 (m)

(19)

Since c(m) is concave, it has left-hand and right-hand derivatives at every
point, though the left-hand and right-hand derivatives may not be equal.
Equation (19) should be interpreted as applying the left-hand and righthand derivatives separately. (Reading (19) in this way implies that c0 (m− ) ≥
c0 (m+ ); therefore V 00 (m− ) ≤ V 00 (m+ )). Taking another derivative can run
afoul of the possible discontinuity in c0 (m) that we will show below can arise
from liquidity constraints. We therefore consider two cases: (i) c00 (m) exists
and (ii) c00 (m) does not exist.
Case I: (c00 (m) exists.)
In the case where c00 (m) exists, we can take another derivative
V 000 (m) = u000 (c(m))[c0 (m)]2 + u00 (c(m))c00 (m)
Absolute prudence of the value function is thus defined as
u000 (c(m))[c0 (m)]2 + u00 (c(m))c00 (m)

From the assumption that ĉ(m) is a counterclockwise concavification of
c(m), we know from Lemma 2 that ĉ(m) ≤ c(m) and ĉ0 (m) ≥ c0 (m).
000 (ĉ(m))

The second part of the absolute prudence expression, − cc0 (m)
, is a measure
of the curvature of 00the consumption function. Since the consumption func(m)
is a measure of the degree of concavity. Formally,
tion is concave, − cc0 (m)
if one has two functions, f (x) and g(x), that are both increasing and

concave functions, then the concave transformation g(f (x)) always has more
curvature than 00f .14 A counterclockwise
concavification is an example of such

Case II: (c00 (m) does not exist.)
Informally, if nonexistence is caused by a constraint binding at m, the effect
will be a discrete decline in the marginal propensity to consume at m, which
can be thought of as c00 (m) = −∞, implying positive infinite prudence at
that point (see (20)). Formally, if c00 (m) does not exist, greater prudence
00 (m)
being a decreasing function of m. This is

The second factor, cĉ0 (m)
, is weakly decreasing in m by the property of a

does not exist because the left and right hand values of ĉ0 are different, we
say that ĉ0 is decreasing if

purposes, when the left and right derivatives of ĉ(m) differ at a point,

Recall from Lemma 2 that ĉ0 (m) ≥ c0 (m) and ĉ(m) ≤ c(m) so non000 (ĉ(m))

D Proof of Lemma 5
Proof. We prove each statement in Lemma 5 separately.
Case I: (u000 > 0.)
If u000 > 0, a counterclockwise concavification around m# implies that
ĉ(m) < c(m) and ĉ0 (m) > c0 (m) for all m < m# . Then

and Lemma 5 holds in the case with u000 > 0 and m < m# .
Case II: (u000 = 0.)
The quadratic case requires a different approach. Note first that the conditions in Lemma 5 hold only below the bliss point for quadratic utility. In
addition, since u000 (·) = 0, strict inequality between the prudence of V̂ and
the prudence of V hold only at those points where ĉ(·) is strictly concave.
Recall from the proof of Lemma 4 that greater prudence of V̂ (m) than
00 (m)
V (m) occurs if VV̂ 00 (m)
is decreasing in m. In the quadratic case
u00 (ĉ(m)) ĉ0 (m)

(23)

where the second equality follows since u00 (·) is constant with quadratic

utility. Thus, prudence is strictly greater in the modified case only if ĉc0 (m)
(m)
strictly declines in m.

E Proof of Lemma 6
We prove Lemma 6 by induction in two steps. First, we show that all results
in Lemma 6 hold when we add the first constraint. The second step is then
to show that the results hold when we go from n to n + 1 constraints.
Lemma 8. (c0t < c0t+1 )
Consider an agent who has a utility function with u0 > 0 and u00 < 0,

35

faces constant income, is impatient (βR < 1), and has a finite life. Then
c0t < c0t+1 .
Proof. The marginal propensity to consume in period t can be obtained
from the MPC in period t + 1 from the Euler equation
u0 (ct (mt )) = βRu0 (ct+1 (R(mt − ct (mt )) + y)).
Differentiating both sides with respect to mt and omitting arguments to
reduce clutter we obtain

Lemma 9. (Consumption with one Liquidity Constraint.)
Consider an agent who has a utility function with u0 > 0 and u00 < 0,
faces constant income, y, and is impatient, βR < 1. Assume that the agent
faces a set T of one relevant constraint. Then ct,1 (m) is a counterclockwise
concavification of ct,0 (m) around ωt,1 .

36

Proof. We now prove Lemma 9 by first showing that the consumption
function including the constraint at the end of period τ is a counterclockwise
concavification of the unconstrained consumption function in period τ .
Next, we show how the constraint further implies that the consumption
function including the constraint is a counterclockwise concavification of
the unconstrained consumption function in periods prior to τ .
We first define τ = T [1] as the time period of the constraint. Note first
that consumption is unaffected by the constraint for all periods after τ , i.e.
cτ +k,1 = cτ +k,0 for any k > 0. For period τ , we can calculate the level of
consumption at which the constraint binds by realizing that a consumer for
whom the constraint binds will save nothing and therefore arrive in the next
period with no wealth. Further, the maximum amount of consumption at
which the constraint binds will satisfy the Euler equation (only points where
the constraint is strictly binding violate the Euler equation; the point on the
cusp does not). Thus, we define c#
τ,1 as the maximum level of consumption
in period τ at which the agent leaves no wealth for the next period, i.e. the
constraint stops binding:
0
u0 (c#
τ,1 ) = βRu (cτ +1,0 (y))
0 −1
c#
(βRu0 (cτ +1,0 (y))) ,
τ,1 = (u )

and the level of wealth at which the constraint stops binding can be obtained
from

0 −1
ωτ,1 = Vτ,1
(u0 (c#
(24)
τ,1 )).
Below this level of wealth, we have cτ,1 (m) = m so the MPC is one, while
above it we have cτ,1 (m) = cτ,0 (m) where the MPC equals the constant
MPC for an unconstrained perfect foresight optimization problem with a
horizon of T − τ . Thus, cτ,1 satisfies our definition of a counterclockwise
concavification of cτ,0 around ωτ,1 .
Further, we can obtain the value of period τ − 1 consumption at which
the period τ constraint stops impinging on period τ − 1 behavior from
0 #
u0 (c#
τ −1,1 ) = βRu (cτ,1 )

and we can obtain ωτ −1,1 via the analogue to (24). Iteration generates the
remaining c#
.,1 and ω.,1 values back to period t.

37

Now consider the behavior of a consumer in period τ − 1 with a level of
wealth m < ωτ −1,1 . This consumer knows he will be constrained and will
spend all of his resources next period, so at m his behavior will be identical
to the behavior of a consumer whose entire horizon ends at time τ . As
shown in step I, the MPC always declines with horizon. The MPC for this
consumer is therefore strictly greater than the MPC of the unconstrained
consumer whose horizon ends at T > τ . Thus, in each period before
τ + 1, the consumption function c.,1 generated by imposition of the constraint constitutes a counterclockwise concavification of the unconstrained
consumption function around the kink point ω.,1 .
We have now shown the results in Lemma 6 for n = 0. The last step is to
show that they also hold for n + 1 when they hold strictly for n. Consider
imposing the n +1’st constraint and suppose for concreteness that it applies
at the end of period τ . It will stop binding at a level of consumption defined
by
0
0
u0 (c#
τ,n+1 ) = βRu (cτ +1,n (y)) = βRu (y)

where the second equality follows because a consumer with total resources
y, constant income, and βR < 1 will be constrained. But note that by the
definition of c#
τ,n , we obtain
T [n]−τ 0
u0 (c#
u (y) < Rβu0 (y) = u0 (c#
τ,n+1 )
τ,n ) = (Rβ)

where T [n] − τ denotes the time remaining to the n’th constraint. From
the assumption of decreasing marginal utility, we therefore know that
#
c#
τ,n ≥ cτ,n+1 .

This means that the constraint is relevant: The pre-existing constraint n
does not force the consumer to do so much saving in period τ that the
n + 1’st constraint fails to bind.
The prior-period levels of consumption and wealth at which constraint
n + 1 stops impinging on consumption can again be calculated recursively
from
0
u0 (c#
τ,n+1 ) = Rβu (cτ +1,n (y))
−1 0 #
0
ωτ,n+1 = Vτ,n
(u (cτ,n+1 )).

38

Furthermore, once again we can think of the constraint as terminating
the horizon of a finite-horizon consumer in an earlier period than it is
terminated for the less-constrained consumer, with the implication that the
MPC below ωτ,n+1 is strictly greater than the MPC above ωτ,n+1 . Thus, the
consumption function cτ,n+1 constitutes a counterclockwise concavification
of the consumption function cτ,n around the kink point ωτ,n+1 .

F Proof of Theorem 2
Proof. Our proof proceeds by constructing the behavior of consumers facing
the risk from the behavior of the corresponding perfect foresight consumers.
We consider matters from the perspective of some level of wealth m for the
perfect foresight consumers. Because the same marginal utility function
u0 applies to all four consumption rules, the Compensating Precautionary
Premia, κt,n and κt,n+1 , associated with the introduction of the risk ζt+1
must satisfy
ct,n (m) = c̃t,n (m + κt,n )
ct,n+1 (m) = c̃t,n+1 (m + κt,n+1 ).

(25)
(26)

Define the amounts of precautionary saving induced by the risk ζt+1 at an
arbitrary level of wealth m in the two cases as
ψt,n (m) = ct,n (m) − c̃t,n (m)
ψt,n+1 (m) = ct,n+1 (m) − c̃t,n+1 (m)

(27)
(28)

where the mnemonic is that the first two letters of the Greek letter psi stand
for precautionary saving.
We can rewrite (26) (resp. (25)) as
Z m
ct,n+1 (m) = ct,n+1 (m + κt,n+1 ) +
c0t,n+1 (µ)dµ = c̃t,n+1 (m + κt,n+1 )ψt,2 (m + κt,2 ) ≡
m+κt,n+1

which implies that

If we can show that (29) is a positive number for all feasible levels of
m satisfying m < ω̄ t,n+1 , then we have proven Theorem 2. We know that
the marginal propensity to consume is always strictly positive and that
κt,n+1 ≥ κt,n ≥ 015 so to prove that (29) is strictly positive, we need to show
one of two sufficient conditions:
1. κt,n+1 > 0 and c0t,n+1 (µ) > c0t,n (µ)
2. κt,n+1 > κt,n
Now, since u000 > 0, we know that κt,n > 0 from Jensen’s inequality. Hence,
κt,n+1 > 0 since κt,n+1 ≥ κt,n . The first integral in (29) is therefore strictly
positive as long as c0t,n+1 > c0t,n , which is true for m < ωt,n+1 by Lemma 6.
For m ≥ ωt,n+1 , we know that c0t,n+1 = c0t,n so the first integral in (29) is
always zero. For the second integral in (29) to be strictly positive, we need
to show that κt,n+1 > κt,n .
First define the perfect foresight consumption functions as
=at,n+1

z}|{
c(κt,n + ζ) = ct+1,n ( st,n +y + κt,n + ζ)

(30)

15 Since we know that liquidity constraints increase prudence (Corollary 1) and that prudence results
in a positive precautionary premium (Lemma 7).

40

c(κt,n+1 + ζ) = ct+1,n+1 (st,n+1 + y + κt,n+1 + ζ).

(31)

where at,n = at,n+1 since m ≥ ωt,n+1 . Recall also the definitions of κt,n and
κt,n+1 :
u0 (ct,n ) = Et [u0 (c(κt,n + ζ))]
u0 (ct,n+1 ) = Et [u0 (c(κt,n+1 + ζ))].
Now recall that Lemma 7 tells us that if absolute prudence of u0 (c(κt,n +ζ))
is identical to absolute prudence of u0 (c(κt,n+1 +ζ)) for every realization of ζ,
then κt,n = κt,n+1 . This is true if mt+1 ≥ ωt+1,n+1 for all possible realizations
of ζ ∈ (ζ, ζ̄), i.e. that the agent is unconstrained for all realizations of the
risk. We defined this limit as mt+1 ≥ ω̄ t+1,n+1 . We therefore know that
κt,n+1 = κt,n if m ≥ ω̄ t+1,n+1 .
For all levels of wealth below this limit (m < ω̄ t+1,n+1 ), there exist
realizations of ζ such that constraint n + 1 will bind in period t + 1. The
agent will require a higher precautionary premia when facing constraint
n + 1 in addition to the n constraints already in the set, implying that
κt,n+1 > κt,n . Equation (29) is therefore strictly positive if m < ω̄ t+1,n+1
and we have proven Theorem 2.

G Resemblance Between Precautionary
Saving and a Liquidity Constraint
This appendix repeats an illustration from appendix G of Carroll Forthcoming. (We make no claim to novelty of this point; it is here only to aid
the intuition of the reader).
In this appendix, we provide an example where the introduction of risk
resembles the introduction of a constraint. Consider the second-to-last
period of life for two risk-averse CRRA utility consumers and assume for
simplicity that R = β = 1.
The first consumer is subject to a liquidity constraint cT −1 ≥ mT −1 , and
earns non-stochastic income of y = 1 in period T . This consumer’s saving

41

rule will be
(
0
if mT −1 ≤ 1
aT −1,1 (mT −1 ) =
(mT −1 − 1)/2 if mT −1 > 1.
The second consumer is not subject to a liquidity constraint, but faces a
stochastic income process,
(
0
with probability p
yT =
1
with probability (1 − p).
1−p
If we write the consumption rule for the unconstrained consumer facing
the risk as s̃T −1,0 , the key result is that in the limit as p ↓ 0, behavior of
the two consumers becomes the same. That is, defining s̃T −1,0 (m) as the
optimal saving rule for the consumer facing the risk,
lim s̃T −1,0 (mT −1 ) = aT −1,1 (mT −1 )
p↓0

for every mT −1 .
To see this, start with the Euler equations for the two consumers given
wealth m,
u0 (m − aT −1,1 (m)) = u0 (aT −1,1 (m) + 1)
(32)
0
0
0
u (m − s̃T −1,0 (m)) = pu (s̃T −1,0 (m)) + (1 − p)u (s̃T −1,0 (m) + 1). (33)
Consider first the case where m is large enough that the constraint does
not bind for the constrained consumer, m > 1. In this case the limit of the
Euler equation for the second consumer is identical to the Euler equation for
the first consumer (because for m > 1 savings are positive for the consumer
facing the risk, implying that the limit of the first u0 term on the RHS of
(33) is finite). Thus the limit of (33) is (32) for m > 1.
Now consider the case where m < 1 so that the first consumer would
be constrained. This consumer spends her entire resources m, and by the
definition of the constraint we know that
u0 (m) > u0 (1).

(34)

Now consider the consumer facing the risk. If this consumer were to save
exactly zero and then experienced the bad shock in period T , she would

42

have an infinite marginal utility (the Inada condition). This cannot satisfy
the Euler-equation as long as m > 0. Therefore we know that for any p > 0
and any m > 0 the consumer will save some positive amount. For a fixed
m, hypothesize that there is some δ > 0 such that no matter how small
p became the consumer would always choose to save at least δ. But for
any δ, the limit of the RHS of (33) is u0 (1 + δ). We know from concavity
of the utility function that u0 (1 + δ) < u0 (1) and we know from (34) that
u0 (m) > u0 (1) > u0 (1 + δ), so as p ↓ 0 there must always come a point at
which the consumer can improve her total utility by shifting some resources
from the future to the present, i.e. by saving less. Since this argument holds
for any δ > 0 it demonstrates that as p goes to zero there is no positive
level of saving that would make the consumer better off. But saving of zero
or a negative amount is ruled out by the Inada condition at u0 (0). Hence
saving must approach, but never equal, zero as p ↓ 0.
Thus, we have shown that for m ≤ 1 and for m > 1 in the limit as p ↓ 0
the consumer facing the risk but no constraint behaves identically to the
consumer facing the constraint but no risk. This argument can be generalized to show that for the CRRA utility consumer, spending must always
be strictly less than the sum of current wealth and the minimum possible
value of human wealth. Thus, the addition of a risk to the problem can rule
out certain levels of wealth as feasible, and can also render either future or
past constraints irrelevant, just as the imposition of a new constraint can.

H Proof of Theorem 3
Proof. To simplify notation and without loss of generality, we assume that
when an agent faces n constraints and m risks, there are one constraint and
one risk for each time period. For example, if cm
t,n faces m future risks and
n future constraints, then the next period consumption function is cm−1
t+1,n−1
(and m = n). Note that we can transform any problem into this notation
by filling in with degenerate risks and non-binding constraints. However,
for Theorem 3 to hold with strict inequality, we need to assume that there
is at least one relevant future risk and one relevant constraint.

43

We know that either the introduction of risk or a introduction of a
constraint results in a counterclockwise concavification of the original consumption function. However, this is only true when we introduce risks in
the absence of constraints (Lemma 3) and when we introduce constraints
in the absence of risk (see Theorem 1). In this proof, we therefore need to
show that the introduction of all risks and constraints is a counterclockwise
concavification of the linear case with no risks and constraints.
Here is our proof strategy. We define a set
m−1
m
1
Pt,n
= {m|cm−1
t,n (m) − ct,n (m) > ct,0 (m) − ct,0 (m)}

(35)

where Theorem 3 holds in period t when we introduce a risk at the beginning
of period t+1. This is defined as the set where precautionary saving induced
by a risk that is realized at the beginning of period t + 1 is greater in the
presence of all risks and constraints than in the unconstrained case.
m−1
In order to show that the set Pt,n
is non-empty, we build it up recursively, starting from period T and adding one constraint or one risk for each
time period. The key to the proof is to understand that the introduction of
risks or constraints will never fully reverse the effects of all other risks and
constraints, even though they sometimes reduce absolute prudence for some
levels of wealth because risks and constraints can mask the effects of future
risks and constraints. Hence, the new consumption function must still be a
counterclockwise concavification of the consumption function with no risks
and constraints for some levels of wealth.
Since a counterclockwise concavification increases prudence by Lemma
4, and higher prudence increases precautionary saving by Lemma 7, our
required set can be redefined as
m−1
m−1
Pt,n
= {m|cm−1
t,n (m) is a counterclockwise concavification of ct,0 (m) and ct,n (m) > m}

where we add the last condition, cm−1
t,n (m) > w to avoid the possibility that
some constraint binds such that the agent does not increase precautionary
m−1
saving. In words: Pt,n
is the set where the consumption function is
a counterclockwise concavification of ct,0 (m) and no constraint is strictly
binding. We construct the set recursively for two different cases: CARA
and all other type of utility functions. We start with the non-CARA utility
functions.

44

0
First add the last constraint. The set PT,1
is then since we know that
cT,1 (m) is a counterclockwise concavification of cT,0 (m) around ωT,1 but that
the consumer is constrained below this point.
We next add the risk at the beginning of period T . To construct the
new set, we note three things. First, by Lemma 1, (strict) consumption
concavity is recursively propagated for all values of wealth where there is a
positive probability that the constraint can bind, i.e.


{mT −1 |ωT −1,1 ∈ mT −1 − c1T −1,1 (mT −1 ) + yT + ζ, mT −1 − c1T −1,1 (mT −1 ) + yT + ζ̄ }

has property strict CC, while it has non-strict property CC for all possible
values of mT −1 . Further, we know from Theorem 2 (rearrange equation
(10)) that
c1T −1,1 (m) ≤ cT −1,1 (m) − cT −1,0 (m) + c1T −1,0 (m)
≤ cT −1,0 (m) − cT −1,0 (m) + cT −1,0 (m) = cT −1,0 (m).
Third, we know that c1T −1,1 (m)0 ≥ c0T −1,0 (m) since c1T −1,1 (m) < cT −1,0 (m) for
m ≤ ωT1 −1,1 , limm→∞ c1T −1,1 (m) − cT −1,0 (m) = 0, and that c1t,1 (m) is concave
while ct,0 (m) is linear. Hence, c1T −1,1 is a counterclockwise concavification of
cT −1,0 around the minimum value of wealth when the constraint will never
bind and the new set is


PT1 −1,1 = {mT −1 |ωT −1,1 ∈ mT −1 − c1T −1,1 (mT −1 ) + yT + ζ, mT −1 − c1T −1,1 (mT −1 ) + yT + ζ̄
∧c1T −1,1 (m) > mT −1 }.
We can now add the next constraint. The consumption function now has
two kink points, ωT1 −1,1 and ωT1 −1,2 . We know again from Lemma 1 that
consumption concavity is preserved when we add a constraint, and strict
consumption concavity is preserved for all values of wealth at which a future
constraint might bind. Further, we know from Theorem 2 that
c1T −1,2 (m) ≤ cT −1,2 (m) − cT −1,1 (m) + c1T −1,1 (m)
≤ cT −1,1 (m) − cT −1,1 (m) + cT −1,1 (m) = cT −1,1 (m) ≤ cT −1,0 (m).
Third, c1T −1,2 (m) < cT −1,0 (m), limm→∞ c1T −1,2 (m) − cT −1,0 (m) = 0,
and we know that if c1T −1,2 (m) is concave while cT −1,0 (m) is linear,
0
then c01
c1T −1,2 (m) which is a counterclockwise
T −1,2 (m) ≥ cT −1,0 (m).

45

concavification of cT −1,0 (m) around the minimum level of wealth at which
the first constraint will never impinge on time T − 1 consumption, ω̄T1 −1,1 ,
and the new set is
PT1 −1,2 = {mT −1 |mT −1 ≤ ω̄T1 −1,1 ∧ c1T −1,2 (m) > mT −1 }.
It is now time to add the next risk. The argument is similar. We still
know that (strict) consumption concavity is recursively propagated and that
limm→∞ c2T −2,2 (m) − cT −2,0 (m) = 0. Further, we can think of the addition
of two risks over two periods as adding one risk that is realized over two
periods. Hence, the results from Theorem 2 must hold also for the addition
of multiple risks so we have
c2T −2,2 (m) ≤ cT −2,2 (m) − cT −2,1 (m) + c2T −2,1 (m)
≤ cT −2,1 (m) − cT −2,1 (m) + cT −2,1 (m) = cT −2,1 (m) ≤ cT −2,0 (m).
0
2
Hence, we again know that c02
T −2,2 (m) ≥ cT −2,0 (m). cT −2,2 (m) is thus a
counterclockwise concavification of cT −2,0 (m) around the level of wealth at
minimum value of wealth when the last constraint will never bind. The new
set is therefore

PT2 −2,2 = {mT −2 |mT −2 −c2T −2,2 (mT −2 )+yT −1 +ζT −1 ∈ PT1 −1,2 ∧c2T −2,2 (m) < m}.
m−1
Doing this recursively and defining ω̄t,1
as the minimum value of wealth
beyond which constraint 1 will never bind, the set of wealth levels at which
Theorem 3 holds can be defined as
m−1
m−1
Pt,n
= {mt |mt ≤ ω̄t,1
∧ cm−1
t,n (m) > m}

In words, precautionary saving is higher if there is a positive probability
that some future constraint could bind and the consumer is not constrained
today.
The last requirement is to define the set also for the CARA utility function. The problem with CARA utility is that limm→∞ cm−1
t,n (m) − ct,0 (m) =
−k m−1 ≤ 0 where k m−1 is some positive constant. We can therefore not use
the same arguments as in the preceding proof. However, by realizing that
equation (10) in the CARA case can be defined as
ct,n+1 (m) − c̃t,n+1 (m) − k̃ ≥ ct,n (m) − c̃t,n (m) − k̃ ≥ 0

46

where the last inequality follows since precautionary saving is always higher
than in the constant limit in the presence of constraints. We can therefore
rearrange to get
c̃t,n+1 (m) ≤ ct,n+1 (m) − k̃ ≤ ct,n (m) − k̃ ≤ ct,0 − k̃
which implies that the arguments in the preceding section goes through also
for CARA utility with this slight modification.

counterclockwise concavification of ct,1 .
